##### IMPORANT NOTE ABOUT XML ######
# No two single XML files have to be same dimension or structure. 
# It is an open-ended, nested data type left to designer unlike dataframes/datasets 
# that are always two-dimensional, rows by columns. 
# ******So a generalizable conversion of any XML to df is not possible. ******
# We need to see your specific XML to tailor accordingly. Show us doc. â€“ Parfait
